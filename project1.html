                <p>
                    AuVault is an Android app that a team and I developed using Thunkable. 
                    The app is tailored to users who are in the jewelry industry and provides a scrap gold calculator 
                    and inventory management system to track their assets.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The scrap gold calculator features the current gold value in grams and ounces. 
                    Additionally, it allows users to change the units from grams to ounces with the press of a button.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The inventory system allows users to take a picture of their asset,
                    as well as the set an id number, enter the weight, carat weight, the total cost of the good, retail value, gold purity, and bin number.
