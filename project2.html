                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This database was developed and managed in SQL in the Third Normal Form using techniques such as stored procedures, functions, 
                    and triggers which improved my appreciation and passion in the field and cemented my knowledge in industry standards.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The database was developed over the course of a semester and gave me new knowledge on how to implement a database at an industry level.
                </p>
